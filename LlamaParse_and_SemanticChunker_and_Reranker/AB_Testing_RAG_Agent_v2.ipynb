Now for each parsed section with its tables removed, we use SemanticChunker to further break it down into chunks to prevent a chunk from having more than one core point and to not have chunks that are too big.

Bing caches the first n results for common queries, but treatments cannot share a cache entry if they return different results for the same request. As the number of concurrent experiments that influence search results increases, fragmentation increases exponentially. For example, our ranker has four layers, and if three treatments (+ 1 control) are running concurrently (on different number lines), we fragment the cache by a factor of 44 = 256! Finally, new features are typically less performance-optimized in early incarnations.\n"

            "{'text': '4 shows the Control with underlines. All our key metrics in short-term experiments showed that underline removal is not good for users: clickthrough rates were down, time to a long dwell-time click degraded, users scrolled more, and monetization suffered [31]. This is even after we implemented features to show underlines on hover, which helped improve the key metrics a bit. In summer 2015 we ran a 10-week experiment on 40% of Bing users to evaluate the long-term impact. The key question we wanted to answer was “does the negative impact diminish over time as users adapt to the no-underline experience?” We also replicated the analysis from the FLT paper to evaluate the methodology. In this experiment we did not see a statistically significant change to Sessions/user despite its large size (over 30 million user), so we assume that any survivorship bias issues are likely to impact Control and Treatment similarly. To study user learning, one approach is to use a cohort of old established cookies that existed prior to the experiment, and analyze their behavior in the post-period. Indeed, if a user came into a long-term experiment towards the end of it, they did not have a chance to learn, therefore diluting the measurement of the learning effect [18]. However, are the results obtained on this cohort generalizable to the whole population? Table I shows a comparison of users in the pre-experiment period and users who remained in the post-experiment period, for the control group in our experiment. 77% of users that existed in the pre-period do not appear in the post-period. This is very well aligned with the comScore study in Section III, which stated that the monthly rate of cookie deletion was 31% in the US. It is conceivable that the loss of users was close to random, and the remaining population is still representative, so the delta between the Treatment and Control would be valid. In our case, however, this is not the case.', 'metadata': {'source': 'Pitfalls of Long Term Online Controlled Experiments (Holdout group).pdf', 'section_title': 'VI.

This comes in two flavors: (i) preventing slightly negative code deployment, which without an experiment might take weeks to identify and roll back (or worse never realizing the negative impact); and (ii) quickly aborting egregiously bad experiments during the canary, or pre-ramp-up phase. See also https://lnkd.in/gNBUddmx\n",
            "2. Encouraging innovation via a safety net. Mature software organizations often hold these dreaded postmortem meetings about failed deployments that caused outages. These meetings foster conservatism over time: QA more, document more, coordinate more, monitor all night. These slow down the development process and discourage risk taking. Once you implement safe deployments (#1 above), there's a dramatic shift: egregious deployments are caught early in a small 2% blast radius and automatically aborted by the platform--no postmortem needed. The postmortems become rare, and focus on the safety net: what metric should we add, which would have caught this\n"

This model is a mathematical representation of data variability, and thus ideally would capture accurately all sources of such variability…These assumptions are often deceptively simple to write down mathematically, yet in practice are difficult to satisfy and verify…”\\n2. “…we will adopt a more general view of the P value as a statistical summary of the compatibility between the observed data and what we would predict or expect to see if we knew the entire statistical model (all the assumptions used to compute the P value) were correct.”\\n3. “The P value is then the probability that the chosen test statistic would have been at least as large as its observed value if every model assumption were correct, including the test hypothesis. This definition embodies a crucial point lost in traditional definitions: In logical terms, the P value tests all the assumptions about how the data were generated (the entire model), not just the targeted hypothesis it is supposed to test (such as a null hypothesis)….include assumptions about the conduct of the analysis, for example that intermediate analysis results were not used to determine which analyses would be presented.”\\n4. “…a very small P value does not tell us which assumption is incorrect. For example, the P value may be very small because the targeted hypothesis is false; but it may instead (or in addition) be very small because the study protocols were violated, or because it was selected for presentation based on its small size.”'"

It represents the chance that, even when a test shows significance (e.g., p < 0.05), the finding is not a true discovery but a false alarm. For example, with a p-value of 0.05, the false positive risk can be much higher than 5%, sometimes as high as 63.4%, depending on the prior probability of a real effect.

In other words, when a statistical test of significance is positive, the FPR tells you the chance that this result is incorrect or misleading.\\n\\nThe context explains that the FPR can be much higher than the commonly assumed 5% threshold associated with a p-value of 0.05. For example, with a p-value of 0.05 and prior odds of 1:10 (meaning the prior probability of a real effect is low), the false positive risk can be greater than 33%, and even as high as 63.4% under certain interpretations. This means that many \"significant\" results may actually be false positives.\\n\\nTherefore, the False Positive Risk is a more direct measure of the likelihood that a significant finding is a false positive, taking into account prior probabilities and the exact p-value observed, rather than just relying on the p-value threshold alone.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",

More precisely, when a statistical test of significance comes out positive, the FPR is the probability that the result is not a true discovery but a false positive. It reflects the chance that the observed significant result does not correspond to a real effect.\\n\\nThis concept is important because even with a p-value threshold like 0.05, the false positive risk can be much higher than 5%, especially when considering prior probabilities and the actual observed p-value. For example, with a prior probability of a real effect of 0.1 and a p-value of 0.05, the false positive risk can be greater than 33%, and in some interpretations, even as high as 63.4%.\\n\\nIn summary, False Positive Risk quantifies the likelihood that a statistically significant result is actually a false positive, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on p-values for claiming discoveries.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",

              "'This is the approach you should take if you want to maximize the speed with which ideas are tested and you are not interested in or concerned with interactions. Large interactions between factors are actually rarer than most people believe, unless they are already known, such as with the buy box example. This is a much better alternative than the traditional approach mentioned first. With the traditional approach you have the limitation that you can’t test until all the factors are ready to be tested. In addition, when you’re done (with many test designs that are recommended) you won’t be able to estimate interactions well if at all. With overlapping experiments you test the factors more quickly and, if there is sufficient overlap in any two factors, you can estimate the interaction between those factors. If you are especially interested in the interaction between two specific factors you can plan to test those factors at the same time. We believe the two alternatives presented above are better than the traditional MVT approach for online experiments. The one you use would depend on your priorities. If you want to test ideas as quickly as possible and aren’t concerned about interactions, use the overlapping experiments approach. If it is important to estimate interactions run the experiments concurrently with users being independently randomized into each test effectively giving you a full factorial experiment.'"

In other words, when a statistical test of significance comes out positive, the FPR tells you the chance that this result is not a true discovery but a false alarm. \\n\\nThe context explains that the FPR depends on factors such as the prior probability of a real effect and the p-value observed. For example, with a prior probability of a real effect of 0.1 and a p-value threshold of 0.05, the false positive risk can be quite high (greater than 33% or even up to 63.4% depending on interpretation). Reducing the p-value threshold to 0.005 can reduce the minimum false positive risk to about 5%.\\n\\nThus, FPR quantifies the likelihood that a statistically significant result is actually a false positive, highlighting that p-values alone can underestimate this risk.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",

        "Based just off of this experiment, we see that LlamaParse + SemanticChunker with 95th Percentile is the winner.\n",
        "\n",
        "That being said, before starting an experiment, we usually have a minimal detectable effect (MDE) that we care about (esepcially when our product is already live, which is the case with A/B AI, and we are trying to make Product improvements). In other words, its the minimum improvement (typically in terms of % Relative Lift vs Control for the OEC) that we design the experiment to detect with high probability (e.g. 80% Power). We then calculate the sample size we need for this, again before the experiment starts. \n",
        "\n",
        "Then after running the experiment, we don't just look at the experiment results and pick the winner based off of which variant did the best. Instead, we want some confidence that the best performing variant actually is better than the Control, as oppose to just witnessing some random noise in the experiment. This can be done with calculating the p-value. However, the p-value doesn't give us a sense of the plausible range of values, and hence how precise our final values in the experiment are. Thus, the p-value is not as informative. \n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we calculate the confidence interval. The most intuitive way to communicate the confidence interval (especially when communicating with stakeholders), is to calculate the confidence interval of the % Relative Lift vs Control for the OEC.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that there are some challenges in calculating the confidence interval of the % Relative Lift (as opposed to calculating the confidence interval of the difference). The variance of the % Relative Lift is NOT simply the variance of the difference divided by the square of the OEC average for the Control! We can use the Delta Method to calculate the variance of the % Relative Lift (and thus easily get the confidence interval from there). We would use Equation 18.6 in Ron Kohavi's book 'Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments' for the variance of the % Relative Lift, using the experiment individual data to estimate the variance of the sample means and filling these into Equation 18.6. Now from here it's easy to get the 95% Confidence Interval of the % Relative Lift.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we have an issue: at most, we have a sample size of 276 here. This is too small to use the Delta Method in good faith (which requires asymptotic normality. Of course this happens with the Central Limit Theorem, but generally requires bigger than a sample size of 276 to be accurate, especially since we care about the tails 2.5% and 97.5% for a 95% Confidence Interval).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not an issue though. We can use bootstrapping instead of the Delta Method. In general, this is easy to do since Ragas provides the individual data for 'result' output, not just the averages (see the cell below). However, to be honest, due to the time crunch because of the rapid pace of this AI engineering bootcamp, I already ran all the cells in the notebook and am only coming back now for this in-depth explanation of experiment analysis (i.e. my focus is on the AI engineering concepts for now, not proper sample size or rigor, due to the time crunch). Thus, I don't have all the 'result' values anymore. That being said, in 2 cells below, we show the code needed to calculate the 95% Confidence Interval of the % Relative Lift vs Control (assuming we have the Control individual data as a list and the test variant individual data as a list).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: in general, the observed % Relative Lift will NOT be the midpoint of the confidence interval using the bootstrap method (unlike when using the Delta Method). This should be considered when communicating with stakeholders"

It reflects the risk that a reported significant result does not correspond to a real effect.\\n\\nThis concept is important because even with a p-value threshold of 0.05, the false positive risk can be much higher than 5%, especially when considering prior probabilities and the actual observed p-value. For example, with prior odds of 1:10 and a p-value threshold of 0.05, the false positive rate can be greater than 33%, and for an observed p-value around 0.05, the false positive risk can be as high as 63.4% under certain conditions.\\n\\nIn summary, False Positive Risk quantifies the chance that a statistically significant result is actually a false positive, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on p-values for claiming discoveries.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",

The reproducibility of research and the misinterpretation of p-values (2017) by David Colquhoun. Great paper about False Positive Risk. This article has only 256 citations, but I found it extremely insightful about the difference between alpha of 0.05 (what he calls p-less-than) and actually seeing a p-value around 0.05 (what he calls p-equals). In our Intuition Busters paper, we gave the false positive risk of p-less-than, which is much smaller than p-equals. 1. “…if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe p=0.00045.”\\n2. “p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk.”\\n3. “When you have done an experiment, you want to know whether you have made a discovery or whether your results could have occurred by chance. More precisely, what you want to know is when a statistical test of significance comes out positive, what the probability is that you have a false positive, i.e. there is no real effect and the results have occurred by chance.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Pvalue Misinterpretations Annotated References.pdf', 'section_title': 'Untitled', 'section_level': 0, 'section_id': 'sec_0_-8297853168768162974', 'chunk_type': 'text', '_id': '7690a8168e65496eb94c6fa76b789efe', '_collection_name': 'kohavi_ab_testing_pdf_collection', 'relevance_score': 0.99298817}, page_content='https://bit.ly/pvalueMisinterpretations\\n\\nGoogle Ads, and Netflix, will have a false-positive-risk of about 24% for alpha &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed, so 0.025 for the positive tail), but for the experiments with a p-value of 0.05 (two-tailed), the false-positive risk is 63.4%! g.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Pvalue Misinterpretations Annotated References.pdf', 'section_title': '4.

Is it appropriate to consider all tests that produce p≤0.047 or should we consider only tests that give p=0.047? Let us call these, respectively, the ‘p-less-than’ interpretation and the ‘p-equals’ interpretations….In other words, the p-equals case is what we need to answer our question.”\\n6. This graph shows the p-less-than and p-equals when the experiment is powered at 78% (it’s not 80% because he uses simulations on small n). Note that at p-value of 0.05, the p-less-than FPR is 36.5%, but the p-equals is 76.6%. Because we usually use a two-tailed test, but are interested in the positive tail only, plugging in 0.025 results in FPR of 24.9% for the p-less-than and 59.6% for the p-equals case. Increasing the power by putting 121,600 (16*0.05*0.95/(0.05*0.05)^2) as the sample size and effect size of .011471 (as multiple of SD, which is 0.05*0.05/sqrt(0.05*0.95)), gives FPR of 23.8% for the p-less-than and 63.4% for the p-equals case.

I love the fact that they show two arguments for lowering the alpha threshold: a Bayesian argument, and a False-Positive-Rate/Risk (FPR). 1. “…we believe that a leading cause of non-reproducibility has not yet been adequately addressed: statistical standards of evidence for claiming new discoveries in many fields of science are simply too low. Associating statistically significant findings with P < 0.05 results in a high rate of false positives even in the absence of other experimental, procedural and reporting problems. For fields where the threshold for defining statistical significance for new discoveries is P < 0.05, we propose a change to P < 0.005.”\\n2. “Results that would currently be called significant but do not meet the new threshold should instead be called suggestive.”\\n3. “Prediction markets and analyses of replication results both suggest that for psychology experiments, the prior odds of H1 relative to H0 may be only about 1:10. A similar number has been suggested in cancer clinical trials, and the number is likely to be much lower in preclinical biomedical research.” In software, the results for many companies are around 1:10, as shown in A/B Testing Intuition Busters. 4. “A two-sided P value of 0.05 corresponds to Bayes factors in favor of H1 that range from about 2.5 to 3.4 under reasonable assumptions about H1… prior odds of 1:10, a P value of 0.05 corresponds to at least 3:1 odds ..in favor of the null hypothesis!”\\n5. “…the false positive rate is greater than 33% with prior odds of 1:10 and a P value threshold of 0.05, regardless of the level of statistical power. Reducing the threshold to 0.005 would reduce this minimum false positive rate to 5%.”\\n6. For objections, they note the following: “The false negative rate would become unacceptably high. Evidence that does not reach the new significance threshold should be treated as suggestive, and where possible further evidence should be accumulated; indeed, the combined results from several studies may be compelling even if any particular…”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Online Controlled Experiments at Large Scale.pdf', 'section_title': '5.1 False Positives', 'section_level': 1, 'section_id': 'sec_1_923351243397566463', 'chunk_type': 'text', '_id': 'ce1687b22ec3496fa8f22226ad499678', '_collection_name': 'kohavi_ab_testing_pdf_collection', 'relevance_score': 0.89552265}, page_content='# 5.1 False Positives\\n\\nFalse positives are “positive findings” that are not actually true.

              "  AIMessage(content='False Positive Risk (FPR) is the probability that a positive finding (a statistically significant result) is actually a false positive—that is, the result occurred by chance and there is no real effect. It reflects the chance that, despite observing a p-value below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.05), the finding is not a true discovery. The FPR depends on factors such as the prior odds of the hypothesis being true and the p-value threshold used. For example, with prior odds of 1:10 and a p-value threshold of 0.05, the false positive rate can be greater than 33%, meaning many \"significant\" results may be false positives. Lowering the p-value threshold to 0.005 can reduce the minimum false positive rate to about 5%. The concept emphasizes that p-values alone do not provide the probability that a result is a false positive, and that the false positive risk is often higher than commonly assumed.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",

The reproducibility of research and the misinterpretation of p-values (2017) by David Colquhoun. Great paper about False Positive Risk. This article has only 256 citations, but I found it extremely insightful about the difference between alpha of 0.05 (what he calls p-less-than) and actually seeing a p-value around 0.05 (what he calls p-equals). In our Intuition Busters paper, we gave the false positive risk of p-less-than, which is much smaller than p-equals. 1. “…if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe p=0.00045.”\\n2. “p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk.”\\n3. “When you have done an experiment, you want to know whether you have made a discovery or whether your results could have occurred by chance. More precisely, what you want to know is when a statistical test of significance comes out positive, what the probability is that you have a false positive, i.e. there is no real effect and the results have occurred by chance.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Pvalue Misinterpretations Annotated References.pdf', 'section_title': 'Untitled', 'section_level': 0, 'section_id': 'sec_0_-8297853168768162974', 'chunk_type': 'text', '_id': '7690a8168e65496eb94c6fa76b789efe', '_collection_name': 'kohavi_ab_testing_pdf_collection', 'relevance_score': 0.9930153}, page_content='https://bit.ly/pvalueMisinterpretations\\n\\nGoogle Ads, and Netflix, will have a false-positive-risk of about 24% for alpha &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed, so 0.025 for the positive tail), but for the experiments with a p-value of 0.05 (two-tailed), the false-positive risk is 63.4%! g.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Pvalue Misinterpretations Annotated References.pdf', 'section_title': '4.

Is it appropriate to consider all tests that produce p≤0.047 or should we consider only tests that give p=0.047? Let us call these, respectively, the ‘p-less-than’ interpretation and the ‘p-equals’ interpretations….In other words, the p-equals case is what we need to answer our question.”\\n6. This graph shows the p-less-than and p-equals when the experiment is powered at 78% (it’s not 80% because he uses simulations on small n). Note that at p-value of 0.05, the p-less-than FPR is 36.5%, but the p-equals is 76.6%. Because we usually use a two-tailed test, but are interested in the positive tail only, plugging in 0.025 results in FPR of 24.9% for the p-less-than and 59.6% for the p-equals case. Increasing the power by putting 121,600 (16*0.05*0.95/(0.05*0.05)^2) as the sample size and effect size of .011471 (as multiple of SD, which is 0.05*0.05/sqrt(0.05*0.95)), gives FPR of 23.8% for the p-less-than and 63.4% for the p-equals case.

I love the fact that they show two arguments for lowering the alpha threshold: a Bayesian argument, and a False-Positive-Rate/Risk (FPR). 1. “…we believe that a leading cause of non-reproducibility has not yet been adequately addressed: statistical standards of evidence for claiming new discoveries in many fields of science are simply too low. Associating statistically significant findings with P < 0.05 results in a high rate of false positives even in the absence of other experimental, procedural and reporting problems. For fields where the threshold for defining statistical significance for new discoveries is P < 0.05, we propose a change to P < 0.005.”\\n2. “Results that would currently be called significant but do not meet the new threshold should instead be called suggestive.”\\n3. “Prediction markets and analyses of replication results both suggest that for psychology experiments, the prior odds of H1 relative to H0 may be only about 1:10. A similar number has been suggested in cancer clinical trials, and the number is likely to be much lower in preclinical biomedical research.” In software, the results for many companies are around 1:10, as shown in A/B Testing Intuition Busters. 4. “A two-sided P value of 0.05 corresponds to Bayes factors in favor of H1 that range from about 2.5 to 3.4 under reasonable assumptions about H1… prior odds of 1:10, a P value of 0.05 corresponds to at least 3:1 odds ..in favor of the null hypothesis!”\\n5. “…the false positive rate is greater than 33% with prior odds of 1:10 and a P value threshold of 0.05, regardless of the level of statistical power. Reducing the threshold to 0.005 would reduce this minimum false positive rate to 5%.”\\n6. For objections, they note the following: “The false negative rate would become unacceptably high. Evidence that does not reach the new significance threshold should be treated as suggestive, and where possible further evidence should be accumulated; indeed, the combined results from several studies may be compelling even if any particular…”'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Pvalue Misinterpretations Annotated References.pdf', 'section_title': 'P-value Misinterpretations – Annotated References', 'section_level': 1, 'section_id': 'sec_1_-3537755286938097082', 'chunk_type': 'text', '_id': '210b9c8b343c4d44985531ef03dfc896', '_collection_name': 'kohavi_ab_testing_pdf_collection', 'relevance_score': 0.92107415}, page_content='-- Greenland et al (2016)\\n\\nWhat will be said in this paper is hardly original. It is, in a certain sense, what \"everybody knows.\" To say it \"out loud\" is, as it were, to assume the role of the child who pointed out that the emperor was really outfitted only in his underwear. -- David Bakan (1966)\\n\\nRather than try and explain p-values, I’ll annotate some of the best references I know. In A/B Testing Intuition Busters (Section 3, Appendix, and newer comments), we called out vendors and book authors for misinterpreting p-values, or coming up with names like “confidence” for (1-p-value), which is misleading. Below are some great references to look at with links to downloadable PDFs. 1. Statistical Errors (2014) by Regina Nuzzo. According to ASA’s statement on p-values (below), the article is “one of the most highly viewed Nature articles.” On Google Scholar, it shows over 1,700 citations. Some excerpts:\\n\\n- “…surprisingly slippery nature of the P value, which is neither as reliable nor as objective as most scientists assume.”\\n- “P values have always had critics. In their almost nine decades of existence, they have been likened to mosquitoes (annoying and impossible to swat away), the emperor’s new clothes (fraught with obvious problems that everyone ignores) and the tool of a \\'sterile intellectual rake\\' who ravishes science but leaves it with no progeny.”\\n- “The more implausible the hypothesis—telepathy, aliens, homeopathy—the greater the chance that an exciting finding is a false alarm, no matter what the P value is.” This fits in with my belief in Twyman’s Law (https://bit.ly/twymanLaw). - “Simonsohn’s simulations have shown that changes in a few data-analysis decisions can increase the false-positive rate in a single study to 60%.”\\n- The figure below, from the paper, makes it clear that with low success rates (priors), a p-value of 0.05 does not provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, a point we made using FPR (false positive risk) in A/B Testing Intuition Busters. I’ve replicated the numbers, allowing you to plug your own in https://bit.ly/PvaluesToBayesPosteriors. Note that in our paper, we looked at the FPR of setting alpha to some value, not for a particular experiment having a given p-value.')]\n"

              "  AIMessage(content='False Positive Risk (FPR) is defined as the probability that a positive result (i.e., a statistically significant finding) is actually a false positive—meaning there is no real effect and the observed result occurred by chance. It quantifies the chance that a statistically significant result does not reflect a true discovery.\\n\\nFrom the context:\\n\\n- FPR is the probability that the results occurred by chance despite a positive test outcome.\\n- It differs from the p-value; while p-values indicate the probability of observing data as extreme as the observed under the null hypothesis, FPR directly addresses the chance that a significant result is false.\\n- For example, with a p-value threshold of 0.05 and prior odds of 1:10 (i.e., low prior probability of a real effect), the false positive risk can be greater than 33%, meaning many \"significant\" findings are likely false positives.\\n- Lowering the p-value threshold to 0.005 reduces the minimum false positive risk to about 5%.\\n- The FPR depends on prior probabilities and the interpretation of p-values (e.g., \"p-equals\" vs. \"p-less-than\" interpretations), with the \"p-equals\" case generally showing a higher false positive risk.\\n\\nIn summary, False Positive Risk is the probability that a statistically significant result is actually a false positive, reflecting the real risk of incorrectly claiming a discovery.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],\n",
